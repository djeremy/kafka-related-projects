# kafka-related-projects


This repo contains my work somehow connected to Kafka. Some projects inside will have useful extensions 
related to common kafka libraries used previously by me on day-to-day basis, 
and some are ready to use solution related to kafka processing. 

Currently, repo consists of:
- [**Process monitor**](./process-monitor/README.md)
- [**KStream type safe branching**](./type-safe-splitter/README.md)
